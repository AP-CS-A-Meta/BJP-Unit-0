# Unit 0: GitHub Classroom Basics

The purpose of this unit is to get familiar with GitHub Classroom and to practice some common tasks on GitHub.

For this unit we'll use a repository I've created called [CHS AP Computer Science Resources 2016][1] - which like it's name suggests is a collection of links to helpful resources for this class. I've seeded the list, your task is to add resources that _you_ find helpful - and to keep adding them throughout the year.

# Objectives

By the time you have completed this unit you should be able to:

* Creating a [_fork_][2] of a repository.
* Creating a _pull request_.
* Creating an _issue_.

# Tasks

1. Create a fork of the repository.
1. Add links to helpful resources that you've found.
1. Create a pull request to have your changes added.
1. Create an issue, suggesting an improvement to the list.
1. Respond to an issue.
1. "Fix" an issue and create a pull request for your fix.
